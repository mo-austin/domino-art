# Domino-Art
This repository contains an algorithm to determine whether a black-and-white pixel-art image can be tiled with 2Ã—1 dominoes. The algorithm also provides a valid tiling configuration if it exists.

## Input
The input is provided as a list of strings, each string representing a row in the pixel-art image. The characters in the strings are either # (black) or . (white).

## Output
1. If the image can be tiled with dominoes, the output should be a list of strings, each containing four space-separated integers. Each string represents the coordinates (column, row) of the cells that a domino will cover.
2. If the image cannot be tiled, the output should be the string "impossible".

## Solution
1. Graph Construction: Treat each black pixel (#) as a node in a graph. Connect adjacent black pixels with edges.
2. Max Flow Problem: Convert the problem into a max flow problem where finding a max flow will determine if a tiling is possible. Use a bipartite graph approach to connect each pixel to potential domino placements.
3. Max Flow Algorithm: Implement the max flow algorithm to check if the maximum number of matches (domino placements) equals the number of black pixels divided by 2.
